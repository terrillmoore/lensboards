# Lensboard designs for Gowland view cameras

This repository has 2D lensboard designs for two kinds of cameras:

1. The Gowland Pocket View 4x5, which uses 100mm by 100mm (4" x 4") 1/16" aluminum lensboards.
2. The Gowland 8x10 view camera, which uses 138mm by 138mm aluminum lensboards.

Notes:

1. Peter Gowland changed the designs from time to time, and offered custom models that accepted Linhof boards, among other things. You should measure your camera before fabbing any of these designs.

2. These designs are optimized for use with [SendCutSend](https://sendcutsend.com/). When ordering, I suggest you select 6061 T6 aluminum, in 0.63" thickness, and black matte powder coating. The hole dimensions are slightly enlarged to allow for the thickness of the coating.
