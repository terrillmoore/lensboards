# Lensboard designs for Gowland view cameras and Omega D2 Enlargers

This repository has 2D lensboard designs for two kinds of cameras:

1. The Gowland Pocket View 4x5, which uses 100mm by 100mm (4" x 4") 1/16" aluminum lensboards.

   * Copal #0 lens board
   * Copal #1 lens board
   * Lens board cover with center hole (for air, or for a knob, or for a pinhole)

   These lensboards will also work with a Calumet CC400, provided that you use some rubber strips to build up the mounting point -- just copy the approach Peter used in the PocketView.

2. The Gowland 8x10 view camera, which uses 138.5mm by 138.5mm aluminum lensboards.

   * Copal #0 lens board
   * Copal #1 lens board
   * Lens board cover with center hole (for air, or for a knob, or for a pinhole)
   * Betax #3 lens board (for Wollensak ExWA III lens, 3 M2.5 screw holes)
   * Alphax #5 lens board (for Kodak Commercial Ektar 14" lens, 4 M3 screw holes)
   * Seiko lens board with S-1 bracket (with either 3 or 12 screw holes -- 12 hole variant allows you to choose the orientation of the bracket).

It also has lens disc designs for Omega D2 enlargers.

Notes:

1. Peter Gowland changed the designs from time to time, and offered custom models that accepted Linhof boards, among other things. You should measure your camera before fabbing any of these designs.

2. These designs are optimized for use with [SendCutSend](https://sendcutsend.com/). When ordering, I suggest you select 6061 T6 aluminum, in 0.63" thickness, and black matte powder coating. The hole dimensions are slightly enlarged to allow for the thickness of the coating.

3. The design for the AlphaX #5 is specifically for the flange that came with my Kodak Commercial Ektar 14" f/6.3. The holes in my flange are on diameters, but not on orthogonal diameters. It also appears that one set of holes is slightly offset (not centered on the origin of the flange). It is possible that the holes were added to the flange by a machine shop, rather than being original from Kodak.

4. In all cases, I increased hole diameters from nominal by 0.326mm. This takes into account the thickness of the powder coat. It's somewhat empirical!

5. Although I've tested these with my lenses, I can't guarantee that these will work with your lenses or your cameras (or enlarger). Use these designs at your own risk.
